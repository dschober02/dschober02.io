                        <p>
                            A basic quiz program in JavaScript consists of a series of questions stored in a structured
                            format, such as an array or object. Each question is paired with its correct answer. As the
                            user answers each question, the program compares their input with the correct answer. For
                            correct answers, a score counter is incremented. At the end of the quiz, the program
                            calculates the total score and displays it to the user. This process involves basic
                            JavaScript logic for looping through questions, handling user input, and comparing answers,
                            making it a simple yet effective way to test knowledge interactively.

                        <p>
                            This project involves coding an airport runway simulation that utilizes queues to manage
                            and simulate the takeoff process for planes. The primary goal is to determine how long each
                            plane waits for takeoff and to decide if a plane has enough fuel to fly as it awaits its
                            turn. As planes are queued for takeoff, the simulation will decrement the fuel levels of
                            each plane, and if a plane runs out of fuel before taking off, it will be flagged. The
                            system will maintain a log of planes that successfully take off and those that are still
                            in the queue, awaiting their turn. This simulation can provide valuable insights into the
                            efficiency of runway operations and the impact of delays on aircraft fuel levels.

                        <p>
                            This program simulates a social media environment by implementing key design patterns.
                            The Observer Pattern enables real-time updates between platforms and users, while the
                            Strategy Pattern provides flexibility in search algorithms. A Factory Pattern dynamically
                            creates instances of various social media platforms with unique characteristics. The program
                            simulates realistic activity by pulling random feeds from a file and injecting them into
                            each platform at its respective update rate. This approach enhances code reusability,
                            maintainability, and adaptability, allowing for the creation of diverse and dynamic social
                            media platforms within the simulation.

                            This Yahtzee project is a fully functional web-based implementation of the classic dice
                            game. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project dynamically renders the game board,
                            dice, and scorecard on the webpage. JavaScript serves as the game's engine, handling all
                            gameplay mechanics, including dice rolling, score calculation, turn management, and game
                            state tracking. By manipulating HTML and CSS, the project provides an interactive and
                            visually appealing user interface, allowing players to visually interact with the game
                            elements and observe score updates in real-time. This project demonstrates a strong

                            in 2022. I am now a captain for my collegiate team at Aurora University, where we are now
                            fighting to become conference champions for the third consecutive year.

                        <h3>Volunteering - Aurora Interfaith Food Pantry</h3>
                        <p>
                            During my time volunteering at the Aurora Interfaith Food Pantry, I assisted in organizing
                            and distributing food to families in need, helping ensure that they had access to essential
                            resources. I worked closely with other volunteers and staff to create a welcoming
                            environment, demonstrating a commitment to supporting the local community. This experience
                            deepened my understanding of food insecurity and strengthened my desire to give back through
                            meaningful service.
